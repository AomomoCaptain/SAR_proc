This NOTS is about some problems with StaMPS processing, written by Zelong GUO.

1. If you are processing a relatively long time series (e.g. 3 years or more), please check the rslc carefully. If there are 0 mean ampltitude with one rslc (it's a black image with rasSLC command plotting), then all of the pscands.1.ij, pscands.1.ll in every PATCHES would not be generated normally at the me_prep_gamma step.s
2. Generally, patches containing < 5 million SLC pixels are OK, i.e., according to a SINGLE rslc image, range_samples*azimuth_nlies/patches < 500,0000 points. The number of patches you choose will depend on the size of your area and the memory on your computer, thus, the patch numbers have nothing to do with the number of interferograms and time span. 
   3. From https://www.gis-blog.com/stamps-2/ 
    3.1. Check for empty interferograms. If any exist, remove files containing the date of the empty file from the folders rslc and diff0. Otherwise, this will throw warnings related to 0 mean amplitude during the final preparation step use in stamps (i.e. mt_prep_snap) and eventually screw up the selection of PS candidates. 
    3.2. The amplitude dispersion index ADD_PS is a value that describes the amplitude stability, which is used to preselect pixels and therefore reduces the number of pixels for the phase analysis. Candidate PS pixels have also already been selected from the interferograms using mt_prep (see beginning of Chapter 6 in the StaMPS manual) The pixels selected have amplitude dispersion < 0.4, where amplitude dispersion is the ratio of amplitude standard deviation to mean amplitude.
    3.3 The recommended range for D_A is 0.4-0.42. The higher the threshold, more pixels will be selected for phase analysis. Note that surfaces like water and vegetation, where amplitude is instable, exhibit higher D_A values than bedrock outcroppings or man-made strucutres (i.e. most likeley PS pixels). See Ferretti et al. (2001) and Hooper et al. (2007) for further information. Additional arguments for mt_prep_snap are only needed for large areas (i.e. if multiple patches are processed).
4. When preselect PS candidates with mt_prep_gamma, at least 100000 PS candidates for every patch is very important. Check it in the log file!!!!!!
5. Before re-run the script after an error, it's really important to detete the relative files when the erroe caused.
